# Components

Place your Vue components here. They can be imported in any other component by using the `~components` alias.

## Global components

Some components we’ve found useful throughout the whole internet are bundled with this starter kit:

- `TheStack.vue`: TheStack is a Vue version of [Every Layout’s The Stack](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/stack/). You can specify its HTML tag using the `tagName` prop (it defaults to a `div`), and the flow direction using `flows` (it defaults to `horizontal`).
