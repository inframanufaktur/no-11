# CSS

You remember css.gif? This ainâ€™t like it.

## Root

The root of this folder should contain CSS entry points. Feel free to add as many as you like. To render them, add the file name in `_src/_data/css.js`.

`custom-properties.css` needs to be an own file to have the props globally available.

## Sub Folders

Use the distinct sub folders to add partials.
